Iâ€™m an Aerospace Engineering student at the
University of Toronto.

I like to make things. Cool things.
Things like graphics, apps, and machines.

I like exploring digital art and design,
reading up on the latest technology,
playing exciting foosball matches,
and discovering music from around the world.

I like economic theory, human factors,
computer science, human-computer interaction,
product design, and marketing.

I like a lot of things.
